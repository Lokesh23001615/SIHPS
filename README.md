## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility.

## Idea
The E-Waste EcoHub is a multifaceted platform designed to streamline the process of disposing of electronic waste while promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness. It integrates location-based services, educational resources, gamification elements, and community engagement to encourage users to responsibly recycle their e-waste.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
E-Waste Guardian is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to tackle the issue of improper e-waste disposal by providing users with easy access to information and resources for responsible recycling. It aims to bridge the gap between individuals looking to dispose of their electronic devices and the recycling facilities equipped to handle such waste.
